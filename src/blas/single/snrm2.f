      data   zero, one /0.0e0, 1.0e0/
c
c     euclidean norm of the n-vector stored in sx() with storage
c     increment incx .
c     if    n .le. 0 return with result = 0.
c     if n .ge. 1 then incx must be .ge. 1

c     modified to correct failure to update ix, 1/25/92.
c     modified 3/93 to return if incx .le. 0.
c
c     four phase method     using two built-in constants that are
c     hopefully applicable to all machines.
c         cutlo = maximum of  sqrt(u/eps)  over all known machines.
c         cuthi = minimum of  sqrt(v)      over all known machines.
c     where
c         eps = smallest no. such that eps + 1. .gt. 1.
c         u   = smallest positive no.   (underflow limit)
c         v   = largest  no.            (overflow  limit)
c
c     brief outline of algorithm..
c
c     phase 1    scans zero components.
c     move to phase 2 when a component is nonzero and .le. cutlo
c     move to phase 3 when a component is .gt. cutlo
c     move to phase 4 when a component is .ge. cuthi/m
c     where m = n for x() real and m = 2*n for complex.
c
c     values for cutlo and cuthi..
c     from the environmental parameters listed in the imsl converter
c     document the limiting values are as follows..
c     cutlo, s.p.   u/eps = 2**(-102) for  honeywell.  close seconds are
c                   univac and dec at 2**(-103)
c                   thus cutlo = 2**(-51) = 4.44089e-16
c     cuthi, s.p.   v = 2**127 for univac, honeywell, and dec.
c                   thus cuthi = 2**(63.5) = 1.30438e19
c     cutlo, d.p.   u/eps = 2**(-67) for honeywell and dec.
c                   thus cutlo = 2**(-33.5) = 8.23181d-11
c     cuthi, d.p.   same as s.p.  cuthi = 1.30438d19
c     data cutlo, cuthi / 8.232d-11,  1.304d19 /
